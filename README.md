# Vit-RNN-Video-Classifier

In this project i created a VIT-RNN Model to do video classification. There are many common ways of video classification such as using models like 3D-CNN,ViVit etc. I wanted to explore this method and comapre it's results.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/ucf101-videos
Code : Vit-RNN Classifier.ipynb

Results are present in the python notebook shared.
